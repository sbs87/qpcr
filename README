README file for qpcr directory/files

This firectory contains scripts related to qpcr/qBiomarker study at IGS

This may initially be a bit of a mess, since I am using gitbhub to sync my efforts across IGS computer(s) (ie., local mac, diag) and personal laptop

Bear with me....

I plan to copy scripts that copy files from flash drive onto local systems
make a script that maps the Ct vals from certain output files to the 384-96 well format
Then, performs downsteam analysis. 

On 5/22 created a script that accomplishes several things:
1. Maps 384 configuration from qBio plate to corresponding quadruplicate model in 96 well
2. Calcualtes mean and stdev for each species/control
3. Propmts user which wells were manually filled or which should be removed as a result of visual outliers (based on boxplot)
4. Saves 3 file: 96 well mapped ct vals, controls only vals, and boxplot.

Future updates:
1. OUtput mapped files and plot in real time so that wells can be entered while looking at plots. Reopen files as needed (multithreading)
2. Output species-level quanitifcation
3. Save a trail of iterative updates, especially boxplot, to track removal and resulitng files (currently need to do this by hand)
4. Make prototocl
5. Document/comment
6. Clean up script to make easier to read and more efficent (i.e., generalize mapping, take out "dummy" component)
