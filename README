README file for qpcr directory/files

This firectory contains scripts related to qpcr/qBiomarker study at IGS

This may initially be a bit of a mess, since I am using gitbhub to sync my efforts across IGS computer(s) (ie., local mac, diag) and personal laptop

Bear with me....

I plan to copy scripts that copy files from flash drive onto local systems
make a script that maps the Ct vals from certain output files to the 384-96 well format
Then, performs downsteam analysis.
